# RNN-Attention-COVID19
Project done by Anil Naidu and Elaine Sui for CSC413 Winter 2021 Term at UofT

This project examines the effects of attention mechanisms on various RNN type architectures. We examine COVID-19 time-series data in this project. The pdf-file is the report which sums up all results and outputs from the code. It also contains the main resources used to help with this project. 

How To Run the Code?

If you want to run the code, either open the .ipynb file in Google Colab and run it, or download the .py file and run it on your own machine. The code requires access to the internet to run, since we get data from an external url. Also, make sure to have all relevant python libraries installed for the code to work on your own computer.
